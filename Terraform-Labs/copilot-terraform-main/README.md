In this fun workshop, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to help you work with Terraform files.

Estimated time to complete: `10 to 45 minutes`

Participants will be guided to install the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension, follow a CodeTour to learn how to interact with GitHub Copilot, and then use GitHub Copilot to update, document and create Terraform files.
